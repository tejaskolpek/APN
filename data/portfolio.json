I have worked across both **enterprise and startup environments**, from optimizing telemetry pipelines at **Dell Technologies** to developing cloud-based data platforms and predictive models at **Shaalastic and IpserLab**. My focus is on creating **reliable, scalable, and secure systems** that transform raw information into intelligent action.\n\nI thrive where **data engineering meets machine learning**, creating pipelines that evolve into **full-stack analytics and MLOps workflows**. Whether it is **Azure, AWS, or GCP**, I focus on how efficiently data flows, how models deploy, and how insights drive meaningful results. My approach is built around solving complex problems with precision, automating wherever possible, and ensuring that every system remains **resilient and self-healing**.\n\nI hold a **Master's in Engineering Science and Data Science** from the **University at Buffalo** and a **Bachelor's in Information Technology**. These programs strengthened my foundation in **cloud computing, big data systems, and applied machine learning**, shaping my ability to bridge data infrastructure with intelligent decision systems.\n\nOutside of work, I find balance in speed and sound, often exploring open roads on my bike or car, or spending time in the gym with hip-hop music pushing my limits. The same energy that drives my rides defines my engineering mindset, always in control, always learning, and always moving forward.","resume":{"tagline":"ðŸ‘‹  I'm a software engineer, product designer.","description":"I have delivered world-class user experiences to millions of people.
